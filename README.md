# SpotCheck -- Pup Friendly Restaurants

## About the app

SpotCheck is mobile app that allows the user to find dog-friendly restaurants nearby or through a city search. The app has a social component: users who login may post restaurant reviews and 'check-in' to a location they are in or very close to.

SpotCheck was built with React Native and supports IOS and Android.  The app uses the Yelp api to find dog-friendly restaurants.  The applications backend is in a separate project and deployed to a Heroku server (https://github.com/GraftonJ/spotcheck-be)

## Check-in

If the user is logged in they may check-in to a restaurant based on their current location.  In this example the two restaurants are very close to each other so the app lists both choices.
